# STpConv (pConv3D)

The code in this repository is based and partly copied from the pConv3D neural netwrok implementation of Marius Appel, that is usedto fill gaps in timeseries of satellite data. Details to the inital model are described in this paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08781 and the implementation of this github repository: https://github.com/appelmar/STpconv.
